They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.\", \"review_title\": \"very good product so far\", \"language\": \"en\", \"product_category\": \"home_improvement\"}, {\"review_id\": \"en_0803843\", \"product_id\": \"product_en_0191712\", \"reviewer_id\": \"reviewer_en_0463661\", \"stars\": 2, \"review_body\": \"Did not charge my psp well at all\", \"review_title\": \"Does not last\", \"language\": \"en\", \"product_category\": \"industrial_supplies\"}, {\"review_id\": \"en_0429399\", \"product_id\": \"product_en_0247225\", \"reviewer_id\": \"reviewer_en_0084768\", \"stars\": 5, \"review_body\": \"Fits great and has been very durable.

This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE.

Seriously there really wasn\\u2019t anything I didn\\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets.

The sound quality out of this didn't significantly change the sound but it's possible I needed to let this thing burn in a little. The treble and bass adjustments worked well and provided a noticeable difference in sound from min to max. Sitting next to my class D amplifier with the cool blue lights on and the gold finish on the nobs looked very cool. Unfortunately when I plugged these in line between my source and my amp and powered it on it gave the speakers a large pulse which made sort of a BOOM sound. When I turned the preamp on and off I kept getting the boom sound which made me feel like it could be sending too large of a signal into my speakers, potentially damaging them. Since I spent good money for high quality speakers I didn't want to run the risk of damaging them with a cheap little pre-amp so I will not be using it anymore.\", \"review_title\": \"Cool pre-amp but could damage speakers\", \"language\": \"en\", \"product_category\": \"electronics\"}, {\"review_id\": \"en_0320076\", \"product_id\": \"product_en_0753523\", \"reviewer_id\": \"reviewer_en_0328326\", \"stars\": 5, \"review_body\": \"The bag was delivered on time.

I figured it would do the same for my face. I wet the brush as suggested for my first use and I did not like that. It was way too soft. Now I only use it dry. I started off and actually continue to dry brush every other day. The first few times my face turned burning red a few hours after the dry brush. This lasted for maybe 2 days. It felt like I had applied retinol to my entire face or got a sunburn. I kept going. I got a few pimples. I kept going. My pimples have healed and now my skin is dry and peeling in some places. Exact same reaction as I had to retinol. (Prescription retinol cream). I started to use argon oil on the peeling skin and that has helped. My skin is so soft and when the peeling settles down and it will my skin will be new and lovely. I no longer get red from the dry brushing and I am not getting pimples. It\\u2019s probably been two weeks of use. I don\\u2019t see much of a difference in my pores, (I have a magnifying mirror). My face feels tighter yet softer. My goal was to nix some of the slack in my skin and maybe help loosen up some wrinkles. I see improvement in my laugh lines but not forehead wrinkles. Pretty sure the skin is now leather on my forehead so that may take some time. Also gently working on eye wrinkles. The goal is to just get some blood circulation to that area. As a result my under eye area has seen less fluid accumulation ie bags. I love the idea and this brush is working well for me. It\\u2019s the only Facial brush I have tried so I have no comparison.

No more late nights or early mornings up cooking turkey all day. Clean up was easy too. It was well worth the price. I just used it to cook a turkey New Years day and it was delicious.

I used an oven mitt to hold the thermometer. It took all of 1 minute. If the gap was towards the bottom, then maybe dry ice is necessary? Mine was towards the top. I suppose the only way around this issue is to not order from Amazon, but in a brick and mortar store so you can inspect for gaps and where they probably kept it vertical at all times and probably removed any gap themselves before putting it on the shelves. Tho it does include a pretty case, the plastic container it was shipped in seems fine as a holder for the thermometer and that is what I am using.

I actually had the idea of a wearable usb cable, came on amazon, and found all the wearable cables already offered. I picked up this one due to the reviews and the looks. I think its important to note that all the people leaving bad reviews because of the \\\"speed\\\" of this cable, are wrong. This is a standard usb cable. Your data transfer rates, and charging speed, all depend on what your plugging the cable into. Leaving a negative review because of this is foolish. With this said, if your planning on using this to charge, you may want to carry around one of those little usb plugs in your pocket, but if you do that.. whats the point of the bracelet really? Be ok with the fact that it may take 8 hours to fully charge your phone in the car, or carry a plug. I'm leaving a 3 star review based on a few different things. I do like the cable, and it has actually helped me a few times to transfer files when i didnt feel like finding a usb cable. My biggest issue with the cable would be the fact that it does pop off. I have small wrists (im 190 lbs and 6 feet tall). The first time the cable popped off, i was taking out the trash. I felt it come off, and found it easily. No worries. Second time it popped off was at a concert. I didnt feel it, and someone found it and returned it. I would of lost it there if that person didnt happen to see it. There should be some sort of clasp or magnet or something to keep it attatched in my opinion. The product description says its waterproof, and it is. Ive tested it by taking it into the shower daily, and then used the cable to charge my phone. The cable holds moisture for a long while. What i mean by this, is if you take a shower at 8am, and try to use the cable at 10am, you'll get a \\\"moisture detected\\\" warning. I cant really fault the cable for doing this, as the page does recommend taking it off during the shower (after stating its waterproof). For me, this cable only works if i keep it on all the time. I'm the type of person that forgets things daily, and having it attatched to me or in my daily carry is the only option, so i tend to keep it on all the time. After about a month of use, the leather on the outside is starting to get somewhat frayed. Not a lot, but very small pieces on the side are coming up. I suspect i'll have another month or two so before it breaks down to the point where i wont use it. A very small point, the edges are a bit sharp. Especially the ones that rest on your wrist. Not a big deal for you, but if you snag someone else with em, you may give em a bit of a scrape. Hugging my son over the weekend, i ended up sliding my bracelet along his back and put a \\\"cat scratch\\\" mark on his back. Honestly it was a pretty nasty scratch, or i wouldnt bother to write it. Things to fix : A better locking system, maybe some magnets or a small latch. Round off the edges. Things to make this product sore : Figure out some way to make a foldable plug so people can get a \\\"fast charge\\\".

I guess they saw how much I liked it and decided it was easier to steal than buy one themselves. So here I am back to buy another one. Going to use the same O-ring fix I described before on this one to keep the silicone piece in place. Seriously, try it if you are having that problem. It works good. Original Review/fix So when I bought this thermos, I read a lot of reviews that people were having problems with the lid. Where the silicone piece would get loose and the lid would fail to open when you push the button. I read that a lot of people were buying new lids from the manufacturer because the silicone piece was not able to be purchased by itself. Well I'm not sure if the silicone piece just ended up getting loose over time, but the problem with mine was shortly after I bought it, that silicone piece started slipping off the lip that is on the cap. So I was trying to figure a way to keep that from happening, and this is what I came up with. Go to Lowe's and buy the delta o-ring set for repairing a faucet. I included a picture with the model number. It has four o rings, they are the same diameter but 2 are thicker. Well I took off the white silicone piece that seals the lid, and I put the two thicker O-rings over the circular area and pushed them down so that the silicone piece that opens the lid cannot slip over the lip. Then I put one of the smaller O-rings at the top of the other two to keep them from moving up. Pictures are included to kind of show you what I did. I've been using it about a week and so far so good. Now if that silicone piece that opens the lid gets too loose then I imagine it will eventually stop opening the lid but my solution fixes it from slipping over the lip. Hope this helps somebody else out there.\", \"review_title\": \"Silicone piece slipping off the lip?

HISTORY: I listen to my iPhone a lot in my car. This was no problem with my iPhone 6 and my 3.5mm cord. When Apple decided to remove the headphone jack from their phones, I had no way to play my music in my car. Enter, AUKEY. I purchased an older model in the summer of 2017. It worked really well: press/hold to turn on, press/hold to turn off. Very often, I listen to videos on Youtube which conveniently has a speaker option so I can verbally say what I want to hear and it will pull it up. One year later, my old AUKEY was dead. I bought THIS model - an upgraded model. It seemed to be the same (albeit rectangular instead of square) and used bluetooth. It connected right away. It turns on with no problem and I can play my phone's music through my car speakers. HOWEVER. Using the AUKEY prevents the speaker function in Youtube from working, entirely. Without the connection established, it works every time with zero problem. With AUKEY turned on, it simply breaks this function of the app. I have no idea why that happens. Second, when you try to turn the AUKEY device off, IT LAUNCHES SIRI. You can't turn it off! I've tested this at least 20 times over multiple days and each and every time, it pulls Siri up on your phone. You have to disconnect Bluetooth from your phone to turn off the AUKEY device. I went from someone who pressed one button and spoke outloud once in a great while to someone who constantly has to fiddle with her phone. I'm shocked it breaks a function of an app and concerned it's launching Siri and not turning off without significant interaction. I never had this problem with the old model - my biggest problem there was it only lasted one year. This one is possessed by some anti-youtube ghost who refuses to let the device shut off. It's sad, because I can't use it for the reason I bought it.\", \"review_title\": \"Possessed Device\", \"language\": \"en\", \"product_category\": \"electronics\"}, {\"review_id\": \"en_0935538\", \"product_id\": \"product_en_0811034\", \"reviewer_id\": \"reviewer_en_0090629\", \"stars\": 3, \"review_body\": \"Neat fish tank, cleaning not as easy as they would have you believe though.

Being the complete newbies in DIY flooring we are, there were very noticable seams in the floor where a new sheet began so I wanted a rug big enough to cover them up. I wanted a 4 ft x 5 ft rug because that's how big my space was, and this was one of the only ones I could find in the material/colors I wanted in that size. Our flooring is true white & gray hexagon sheet vinyl. I read reviews that said that the rug was definitely off-white instead of true white, but i loved the print, the size and the material seemed perfect for a kitchen. Since our flooring is so stark white,by comparison it makes the rug seem even more brown than white. But, we plan to paint our lower cabinets black and install butcher block wood countertops so I'm thinking the colors of the rug will match better (the off-white/brown colors in the rug will pop with the countertops). So, to summarize, PROS: -I LOVE the pattern of the rug -the material seems very easy to clean in a kitchen (or outdoors) -it is pretty soft (not plasticy or scratchy like some rugs) considering it can be used as an outdoor rug -the size fits perfect in my space -THE PRICE IS AMAZING.

DISAPPOINTED in this purchase. It sounds like something that is short circuiting. I am very annoyed that I made this purchase and lost out on my money. To send it back I will have to pay return shipping. I hope the seller sees this review. Also they sent an email asking me about my purchase when I select the link to complain it\\u2019s saying I am log logged in to the account I used to make the purchase smh.

After over a month of trying to get Amazon and/or the company to respond, the company finally responded and send a replacement pump. This one crapped out in 36 hours. Amazon is so big now that they don't know when they're selling knock offs and lemons. The ratio of good products to lemons is shifting in favor of lemons. Old review: This is a great product when it works, BUT: We purchased this item a little over one month ago. We set it up and began using it about three days after it arrived. Within the month of purchasing it, it has broken in different ways six times. The first 5, my husband was able to repair it himself. However, the sixth time, the necessary repairs are beyond the scope of our ability. So I checked on Amazon how we could exchange it for a model that WORKS. Sadly, we missed the window for which Amazon is willing to replace the defective product by about 10 days. This is extremely frustrating -- almost as if it's built only to last during the warranty period, after which it irreparably breaks and there is no possibility of exchanging it for a model that works. We invested plenty of our own time and energy repairing it ourselves, so we believe we have been plenty generous in terms of holding up our end of the bargain. Now it is entirely useless and we can't return or exchange it. To put it another way: THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP-OFF. THE BUYER PAYS FOR A LEMON, AND IN RETURN, AMAZON SAYS \\\"TOO BAD, NOT OUR PROBLEM\\\" WHEN THE PRODUCT FAILS. THE BUYER IS OUT $$$ BUT AMAZON DOESN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELLING A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME AMAZON HAS RIPPED US OFF (THE OTHER WAS A PAIR OF WIRELESS EARBUDS PURCHASED DURING THE AMAZON PRIME DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST THAT NEVER WORKED AT ALL -- AND NOT JUST US -- BUT SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT AMAZON ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN THE REVIEW SECTION MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WARN OTHER BUYERS OF THE SCAM) We have been good customers of Amazon from the beginning. However, the customer service is getting worse and worse every day. Now that Amazon and Bezos have more money than several small countries, not to mention the VAST number of consumers who have placed our trust in Amazon, purchased probably THOUSANDS of their products, and contributed greatly to the company's wealth (which, according to their hardworking employees, does NOT trickle down by investing in the employees who actually do the hard work). Compare this to a friend of mine who bought a Fitbit many months ago and decided she didn't like the design and Amazon didn't make her jump through hoops or pay shipping/return charges, they simply sent her a brand new one in a style she liked. That Fitbit cost about 5x more than the two products I've tried to return, but our customer service experiences are vastly different. Part of Amazon's game is to make returning a defective product such a hassle that the customer ultimately gives up and buys a new product, eating the financial loss. AMAZON. DOES. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. CUSTOMER. SERVICE. ANY. MORE. So what am I paying the \\\"Prime\\\" membership for? Being a Prime customer is getting more expensive, yet the \\\"services\\\" covered under #Prime are eroding to the point that there's virtually no benefit to being a Prime customer. Yes, I've talked more about Amazon's business practices than the lemon product I should be reviewing here. But how can I review a product that has spent more time not working than working? And if Amazon doesn't have my back when I'm spending tons of money on this site? Who has MY back?

I suggest an extension cable as a result. The plug is not grounded therefore it fits in small places like a power strip. The product's fan can be loud depending on your viewing, but the sound quality produced by the speakers does well to cover up the ambience. With a quick set up, I was able to get a fair quality picture though the text of the Chrome tabs was difficult to read from the display. Zooming in on the projecting device, like a computer, can aid this. The remote is very helpful and even has a slight glow to it, but it is not backlit so you need some light, even the light of the projector, to first navigate the buttons. I projected from approximately 8ft, and did notice the grid lines made by what I assume are the pixels. this results in a less smooth image, but does little to interfere with the actual display.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it gives me weird dreams and it's pretty expensive for what's in it.

SPOILER ALERT: It actually does a full back flip, which both surprised us and impressed us. We were sad though when it broke at the end of 1st day.

The seller really wanted me to update my review to 5 stars, but I am still not there yet, as the gold is not a match to the watch, and therefore I dont think I will use it very often, and dont care for the black or clear, but otherwise, I think these are great cases. Original review: Punchline: I sent these back for a refund. Details: These cases will likely do a decent job protecting your watch. They cover the screen and metal on the watch. The cutouts line up nicely, and the touch screen works well with it on. That being said, it looks like crap on. The bulky clear case makes the watch look cheap and tacky. I'd rather take the risk that I might get a small scratch than have this make my watch look ugly for sure. See my pictures of my watch both with and without the case on to see what I mean.\", \"review_title\": \"Works, but its ugly... updated\", \"language\": \"en\", \"product_category\": \"wireless\"}, {\"review_id\": \"en_0877798\", \"product_id\": \"product_en_0176760\", \"reviewer_id\": \"reviewer_en_0441434\", \"stars\": 4, \"review_body\": \"my wife says they work as expected\", \"review_title\": \"fast shipping\", \"language\": \"en\", \"product_category\": \"drugstore\"}, {\"review_id\": \"en_0676092\", \"product_id\": \"product_en_0732810\", \"reviewer_id\": \"reviewer_en_0864770\", \"stars\": 3, \"review_body\": \"They're nice, but the sole has split apart at the toe after only 3 months.\", \"review_title\": \"Three Stars\", \"language\": \"en\", \"product_category\": \"shoes\"}, {\"review_id\": \"en_0387766\", \"product_id\": \"product_en_0304785\", \"reviewer_id\": \"reviewer_en_0013852\", \"stars\": 3, \"review_body\": \"The size is too big.

Ok, so let's talk about what came in the box. It includes a nice remote, the A/V cables, power cord, and a bonus HDMI cable! The packaging is really high quality and projector looks and feels so as well. Setup was super easy, about 2mins and I had YouTube projected on my wall. I have to say the picture quality was way better than I expected! I don't even currently have a screen, so I was projecting it on my bare wall that's not even white. I will say, it does help to have it as dark as possible when watching. If there is a negative, it's that it's not crazy bright, but I didn't expect that for a sub $200 HD projector. With that said, I think it's just fine in most cases. I imagine with a proper screen, or even a flat white wall, it would look dang good.

But the overall feel was vastly different - the first two cuts with the old blades seemed to be as close as a classic straight razor, while the first few uses with these felt more like getting plucked. After the wear-in period, the old blades cut pretty well, needing a couple of passes to get a truly clean cut (with the number of passes creeping up over the following months)...these seemed to immediately go to the year-old dullness level. The ultimate failure of these blades was evidenced by my shave this morning. The mirror was fogged up and I didn\\u2019t have a lot of time before heading off to work, so I made the usual three or four passes, emptied some cuttings out of the head of the shaver, and got on with the day.

However, a couple of comments to be aware of. First, when plugged into a US outlet, the unit is vertical and you can't lay the phone on it to use the wireless charger. If you have plugged it into an extension cord or power strip, you can lay it horizontally to use the wireless charging. However, needing a cord kind of defeats the universal nature of this charger. Secondly, If you leave the USB cable plugged in, but unplug your phone, the USB charger will shut off after a few seconds. Plugging the phone into the loose end of the cable does not turn the charger back on and you need to either press the power button, unplug and replug the USB cable, or unplug the unit from the wall. As I tend to leave the unit plugged into the wall with the USB cable attached, plugging the phone into the end of the USB cable did not turn the charger on and consequently my phone didn't charge overnight. This is different behavior from other chargers I have used where I can leave the charger plugged in with the cable attached and just connect my phone to the end of the cable and have it charge up.

I have had it about 2 weeks now and have used it with real clubs known distances and inside on big tv. First inside with the pratice club that comes with the device takes some getting use to. It is easy to pair with my phone and took me about 2 minutes to set it up. Very user friendly. As far as true yardages inside with the pratice club. The pratice club is weighed to a 7 iron my normal 7 iron Carrie's in the air 158 with a regular swing. With the pratice club inside I average 128 which is very different from my true yardage. The device is pretty true on ball flight as far as open or closed face. Now to real clubs again my 7 iron average stock swing is 158 yards. With the device on my real club it shows I am hitting it a average of 141 which is closer but still a large gap. On the driver my average drive carry is about 240 to 250 the device shows it at 216 carry. Again the ball flight with the clubs and pratice club is pretty true. My overall take it is fun, gives some feedback on club face angle and at least has you swinging a club. Especially at night or weekend to play a few holes when you can't go play. I would have given 5 stars if the yardages were closer to true yardages I hit. But for the price and entertainment level for me I am happy with it for what I am looking for.

But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \\\"dust\\\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty.

I have a 125lb Rottweiler who lives indoors, but when he goes outside he likes to patrol the fence and sometimes likes to do the annoyance bark (at airplanes, a leaf blowing by, a dog barking in the distance, etc.) so I put this on him when he goes outside for extended periods (probably 2-3 times a week for a total of 2-3 hours).

The fitness application is very helpful during physical activity with the active heart rate tracking and flashing color code designating heart rate zone.

How many times have you not been able to charge when your band charger adapter is not available? Just use any phone or tablet charger or computer usb outlet. Just release one side of band and USB end is available for charging. -Color display is amazing being large enough and bright enough to see in all lighting conditions with a quick glance. - Color display automatically adjusts to light conditions so brighter in day...muted after dark. - Activity tracker - Band is very comfortable Negatives: - Have experienced several episodes of Bluetooth becoming un synced with phone. Usually requires a quick re connect in phone settings if it does not automatically re connect. However, have had to reboot phone a few times to resync. - 5 day battery is nice and very much within norm for the amount of functions that this band provides but a full 7 day battery life would be better.
